# Treasure Hunt with Pandas
In this project, we embark on an exciting treasure hunt using Pandas for data exploration and data cleaning. The treasure map is represented by a CSV file, and we navigate through the rows and columns to discover the hidden treasure. Along the way, we use Pandas functions to retrieve specific cells, concatenate strings, and uncover the final clue. Join us in this thrilling adventure with Pandas!

# Mind the Gap
In this part of the project, we delve into the fascinating Gapminder dataset. We explore geographical, socioeconomic, and health data to gain insights into global trends. Using Pandas, we analyze the dataset, answer questions about population, life expectancy, GDP per capita, and more. Join us as we uncover valuable information and understand the dynamic world we live in.

# Dirty to Clean
In this data cleaning task, we encounter the "Dirty Gapminder" dataset. Our mission is to transform the dirty dataset into a clean and organized format that matches the original "Clean Gapminder" dataset. We leverage the power of Pandas to handle missing data, fix capitalization, handle whitespace, and ensure consistency. Join us in this data wrangling journey as we bring order to the chaos and create a pristine dataset.

Feel free to explore the project file and dive into the code. Happy exploring and happy cleaning!
